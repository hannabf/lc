# Week 2 Strudel Experimenting
I wanted to make a layered groove focusing on playing with randomness as well as Strudel's approach to meter and subdivisions. 

```
stack(
"[oh hh!2] [hh!3] [hh!3] [hh!3]",
"[clap ~!2] [clap clap? ~] [clap? clap? ~] [~!2 clap?]",
"[bd ~] [bd ~] [bd!2 ~] [~ ~ bd?]",
"[gm_voice_oohs] [gm_voice_oohs?] [~!2 gm_voice_oohs] [~ gm_voice_oohs ~]"
).s() 
```
I wanted to try to add some more pitched notes as well as panning BPM changes, but kept inputting it wrong I think? I still need to mess around with those some more, but I think for right now I feel really confident creating drum-machine-style code, enough to also edit it in real-time in a musical way.
