# Week 8: Baby's First TidalCycles
This is. Absolute nonsense LMAO

I thought I was gonna have a bit less of a learning curve than I actually ended up having, something about the few minor changes from Strudel's commands are kind of slowing me down right now but I decided to just allow myself to make something pretty straightforward and goofy to focus more on learning how I like structuring things in TidalCycles vs trying to jump into making something really ambitious. I feel like the first two layers work well together and then anything else I added from there was kinda uncohesive but I'm alright with how it ended up sounding. And after a crazy week sometimes you just wanna make sheep techno.

I think I also took for granted how nice it was to have everything I could possibly want to look at in front of me in Strudel, I feel like I'm fighting for my life trying to scroll through the SuperCollider terminal just to see what patches I have available. The "tutorials" are also kind of hard to navigate like we brought up a bit in class, but there are enough similarities to Strudel that I didn't feel like there was anything I completely couldn't figure out. It did take my full restraint not to include "xmas", maybe for the final.
